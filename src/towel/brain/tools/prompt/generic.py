## FORMAT

### TOOL CALLS
If you believe a tool needs to be used to answer a question, respond with a JSON object in this format:

[{{
    "text_response": "explain your response here",
    "tool_call": {{
        "tool": "tool_name",
        "args": {{"arg1 name": value1, "arg2 name": value2}}
    }}
}}]

this JSON object should contain both a tool call JSON and a text response JSON explaining your response.

### NO TOOLS
In all other cases, When none of the tools are found in the list or need to be called to answer the question, use this JSON format to respond:

[{{
    "text_response": "Your response here"
}}]

This JSON object should contain just a text response JSON.

## TOOL INSTRUCTIONS

Do NOT return "tool_call" unless you have all the required arguments for the tool.
For example:

  args: {{'key': '', 'value': ''}} is NOT valid if real values for both key and value are needed for a tool to run.

Do NOT fake and make up values for the arguments.
If you don't have all the required arguments, respond with JUST a text_response in a JSON object

If a tool needs to be called respond with both a tool call and a text response JSON explaining your response.
If a tool does not need to be called respond with just a text response JSON.
